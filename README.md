## About FeStats (read: IronStats)
FeStats is a TUI statistics program, covering hypothesis tests, regressions, and probability. 
It uses `inline-python` and `pyo3` to provide access to `scipy`. 

## Usage

- `festats`

## Installation (Soon!)

- Cargo: `cargo install festats`

- AUR: `paru -S festats`

## Roadmap:

- [ ] Major refactoring - initial versions are done with a "MVP" perspective

- [ ] Handle most common statistics and probability formulas

- [ ] Handle list operations (such as for regressions)

## Building:

In order to build FeStats, you must have `python3` installed, and use the `nightly` Rust toolchain.

## Support:
